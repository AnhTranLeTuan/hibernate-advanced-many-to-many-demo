# Hibernate advanced: Many-to-many Relationship

## Description
Experiment with concepts of Hibernate, ORM (Objectâ€“relational mapping), and many-to-many mapping. In this project, we can see how:
* Configure Hibernate in the XML file (/hibernate-advanced-many-to-many-demo/src/hibernate.cfg.xml)
* Create entities in which Java classes or their objects will be mapped to the database's table (entity/...)
* Establish many-to-many mapping between entities (demo/...)
* Map objects to tables of MySQL
* Test features of many-to-many mapping
